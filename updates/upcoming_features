#Upcoming features

Some of the major future updates will include:
* Re-implement some of the missing features from 2.x - 2018
* **Anti-PMspam** - Rather complex system which may as well end up being separate bot which will include only our standard antispam plus this new feature. (2019?)
* **Botwinder 4.0** - Who knows what major news would this one bring? (2019-2020)

Definitely check out our [github milestones](https://github.com/RheaAyase/Botwinder.core/milestones) and issue tracking to get a better idea!
